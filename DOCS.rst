============================
Phate's Aberrant Paternoster
============================

| A toy markup language...
| Whose interpreter/transpiler is based on my work on `bcalc <https://github.com/Phate6660/bcalc>`_.

| Currently there is no functioning implementation.
| Working on writing out syntax/specifications right now.

Basic Syntax
------------

- ``_!bold text!_``
- ``_/itatic text/_``
- ``__underlined text__``
- ``_`inline codeblock`_``
